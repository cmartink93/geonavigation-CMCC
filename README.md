# geonavigation-CMCC
Pieces of my work with Gianandrea Mannarini at CMCC

The goal of this project was to find the fastest, safest route across the Atlantic Ocean using network theory, boat structural
information, and eventually CMCC data regarding ocean current magnitude and direction. Dr. Mannarini had created a small version
of this across the Mediterranean Sea in MatLAB, and had me translate it into Python while also adding a more complex and 
accurate network between various coastal ports across the ocean. 

This has not been published, so I have only included small pieces of code, but Dr. Mannarini's work in this area continues.
